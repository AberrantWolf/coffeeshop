# Coffee Shop

A distributed voice chat client/server for simulating working in an environment with other people -- using actual other people as well as processing environmental effects such as distance and audio hitting your ears at different times (i.e., crossfeed) so that what you hear feels more like a normal social experience akin to working in an office or a coffee shop rather than sitting on voice comms all day.

The goal is for people who work from home to be able to feel a bit more socially connected without losing any more productivity than they would at a normal office.

Plus, if you're the kind of person who likes to pop in and help other programmers when they start swearing at their code... well... this would help afford you that opportunity.

## Notes

* This project doesn't do much of anything yet. It's way early, and the above description is merely aspirational at this point.

* I'm so sorry about the installation for the Rust SFML library files, but you're gonna have to go do that and follow their instructions. It's kind of a pain on Windows, and I hope it's more straightforward on other platforms.
